I am a hands-on, boots-on-the-ground scientific researcher currently at Univerity of Oxford, Department of Physics. I dabble with reduced-complexity modelling and cloud-optimised solutions to bring AI to regions that lack GPUs!</span></p><p><span>Find my full </span><a href="https://github.com/snath-xoc/Lifting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>CV here </span></a></p><h2 id="Projects" data-id="Projects"><span>Projects</span></h2><ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/snath-xoc/Lifting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Lifting Scheme</span></a><span>: Wavelet based scheme for irregular mesh compression extended to a spatio-temporal framework.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/snath-xoc/sample-weight-audit-nondet/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Auditing tool for imbalanced learning</span></a><span>: Sample weights applied under imbalanced learning need to be correct. This tool checks that for non-deterministic estimators properties such as equivalence between weighted and repeated samples are respected.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/snath-xoc/xarray_loader/tree/master" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Xarray batch streamer</span></a><span>: allows streaming and on-the-fly batching of large multi-dimensional data. It is still a work in progress with the hope of pipelining weather data for cloud-based AI model training.</span></li>
