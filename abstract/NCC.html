    ments face challenges to appraise the growing literature. Here we use the language model BERT to identify and classify studies
    on observed climate impacts, producing a comprehensive machine-learning-assisted evidence map. We estimate that 102,160
    (64,958–164,274) publications document a broad range of observed impacts. By combining our spatially resolved database
    with grid-cell-level human-attributable changes in temperature and precipitation, we infer that attributable anthropogenic
    impacts may be occurring across 80% of the world’s land area, where 85% of the population reside. Our results reveal a sub-
    stantial ‘attribution gap’ as robust levels of evidence for potentially attributable impacts are twice as prevalent in high-income
    than in low-income countries. While gaps remain on confidently attributabing climate impacts at the regional and sectoral level,
    this database illustrates the potential current impact of anthropogenic climate change across the globe.</span>
