Welcome to my personal web page! I am a hands-on, boots-on-the-ground scientific researcher currently at Univerity of Oxford, Department of Physics. I dabble with reduced-complexity modelling and cloud-optimised solutions to bring AI to regions that lack GPUs!

## Projects

* [Lifting Scheme](https://github.com/snath-xoc/Lifting): Wavelet based scheme for irregular mesh compression extended to a spatio-temporal framework.
* [Auditing tool for imbalanced learning](https://github.com/snath-xoc/sample-weight-audit-nondet/tree/main): Sample weights applied under imbalanced learning need to be correct. This tool checks that for non-deterministic estimators properties such as equivalence between weighted and repeated samples are respected.
* [Xarray batch streamer](https://github.com/snath-xoc/xarray_loader/tree/master): allows streaming and on-the-fly batching of large multi-dimensional data. It is still a work in progress with the hope of pipelining weather data for cloud-based AI model training.
